'ILogger<DashboardService>' has no applicable method named 'LogInformation' but appears to have an extension method by that name. Extension methods cannot be dynamically dispatched. Consider casting the dynamic arguments or calling the extension method without the extension method syntax.
'MaterialDashboardView' does not contain a definition for 'CreatedAt' and no accessible extension method 'CreatedAt' accepting a first argument of type 'MaterialDashboardView' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
