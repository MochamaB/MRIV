  Implementation Priority

  Phase 1: Core Documentation         
  (Immediate Need)

  1.
  RoleGroupAuthorizationSystem.md     
  - Master reference
  2. VisibilityAuthorizeService_Re    
  ference.md - Service
  documentation
  3. AuthorizationTestMatrix.md -     
  Testing reference
  4. PermissionMatrix_QuickRef.md     
  - Quick reference

  Phase 2: Integration 
  Documentation

  5. WorkflowAuthorization.md -       
  Workflow integration
  6. EntityVisibilityMatrix.md -      
  Entity-specific rules
  7. OrganizationalHierarchy.md -     
  Data structure reference

  Phase 3: Operational 
  Documentation

  8. RoleGroupManagement.md -
  Admin procedures
  9. ExtendingAuthorization.md -      
  Developer guide
  10. TroubleshootingGuide.md -       
  Support reference

  This comprehensive documentation    
   structure would provide
  multiple entry points for
  different stakeholders
  (developers, testers,
  administrators) while
  maintaining cross-references        
  between documents. Each document    
   would serve a specific purpose     
  while contributing to the
  overall understanding of the        
  authorization system.

  The key benefit is that future      
  feature development, testing, or    
   troubleshooting could reference    
   the appropriate document(s)        
  without requiring the full
  analysis we just performed.
